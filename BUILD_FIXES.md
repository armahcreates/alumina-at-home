# Build Error Fixes Applied

## All Issues Fixed!

### 1. Apostrophes already escaped in:
- `components/Dashboard.tsx:168` - Already uses `&apos;`
- `components/Progress.tsx:134` - Already uses `&apos;`
- `components/Supplements.tsx:50` - Already uses `&apos;`
- `components/auth/OnboardingFlow.tsx` - All apostrophes already escaped

### 2. TypeScript Type Issues - FIXED
- **VideoLibrary.tsx** - `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warning
  - Fixed by properly typing ReactPlayer as `React.ComponentType<ReactPlayerProps>`
  - Removed eslint-disable comment
  - Created proper type definition for ReactPlayer props

### 3. Chakra UI Prop Issues - FIXED
- **All components** - Replaced `flexDirection` with `flexDir` throughout:
  - `components/VideoLibrary.tsx`
  - `components/EquipmentGuide.tsx`
  - `components/Environment.tsx`
  - `components/Dashboard.tsx`
  - `components/auth/OnboardingFlow.tsx` (2 instances)
  - `components/LoadingSpinner.tsx`
- This aligns with Chakra UI v3 best practices

### 4. Browser Compatibility - VERIFIED
- **backdrop-filter** - All usages have proper fallback backgrounds
  - Every `backdropFilter` prop has a corresponding `bg` prop
  - Ensures compatibility with older browsers (Firefox < 103)

### 5. Image Component Usage - VERIFIED
- **app/page.tsx** - Already using Next.js `<Image>` component correctly
  - All images properly imported from `next/image`
  - No warnings about using `<img>` tags

### 6. Unused Variables - VERIFIED
- **EquipmentGuide.tsx** - `index` variable is actually used as React key
  - No unused variable warning
- **lib/store.ts** - Already handled with eslint comment

## Summary

All build errors and UI issues have been resolved:
- No TypeScript errors
